    "* We assume that the cell maintains a constant mass density, so that the cell volume is always proportional to the cell  mass, which is equal to $E + R + A$ (we assume that $E$, $R$ and $A$ have the same mass). We choose the mass and volume units so that $M = V$. This means that mass fractions and concentrations are equivalent"

    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1) What is represented by $R$? What are the generic names for the enzymatic constants $\\sigma$ and $a_{sat}$?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) In your opinion, should $k$ depends on the composition of the media? And on the strain genotype?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Write down differential equations representing the temporal evolution of the **amounts** of $A$, $E$ and $R$\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Find a simple expression for the instantaneous cell growth rate $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{V} \\frac{dV}{dt}$ (think mass conservation and combine the differential equations)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **BONUS question - not required to continue**. Write down differential equations representing the temporal evolution of the **concentrations** $a$, $e$ and $r$ of $A$, $E$ and $R$\n",
    "\n",
    "6) This model seems to always reach a state of steady (or balanced) exponential growth, where all components increase at the same (exponential rate), while the concentrations of components remain constant. To which extent is this steady-state dependent on initial conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "7) What growth rate and concentrations do you expect at steady-state for the extreme cases $f_E = 0$ and $f_E = 1$?\n",
    "\n",
    "8) From now own we will fix $\\sigma = 1$ and $a_{sat} = 0.01$ (this is the case for the interactive simulations and plots above). Propose a fixed allocation strategy (i.e. a value for $f_E$) for the three following conditions: $k = 0.25$, $k = 1$ and $k = 2.5$. Your goal is to grow as fast as possible !\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Describe with your words what governs how good a given choice of $f_E$ is. What kind of trade-off seems to be important ?\n",
    "\n",
    "9) **Open question**. Propose a mathematical function $f_E = f(k)$ representing the best strategy to adopt as a function of $k$. The perfect answer is probably hard to find, so try to find a good enough and simple enough function. We will compare in class different choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) **Open question**. Let's assume that a cell can dynamically regulate or adapt its allocation strategy represented by the value $f_E$. Let's also assume that a cell can only sense **ONE** of the three internal concentration $e$, $r$ and $a$. What would you choose to sense in order to adapt the value of $f_E$? Let's call it $x$. Propose a dynamic regulation function $f_E = f(x)$ that you think is good (i.e., allows you to grow near optimally for a large range of environments, represented by different values of $k$). Don't forget that $f_E = 1 - f_R$, so you can also decide to have $f_R$ being primarily regulated. \n",
    "\n",
    "11) **BONUS question**. Adapt the code below to simulate the case where $f_E$ is dynamically regulated as you proposed above."
